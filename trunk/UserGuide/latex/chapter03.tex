% \chapter{Intensity Matrix}
% Each scan only
% contains information about the mass/charge and intensity at intensity peaks in
% the scan. This means that consecutive scans do not necessarily contain the
%same
% mass/charge values. For data processing, it is often necessary to convert the
% data to a matrix with a set number of mass/charge values and number of scans.
% This means some mechanism for converting mass/charge values to a set of fixed
% values is required. In PyMS there are functions to explicitly handle the
% conversion of mass/charge values to consistent values across all scans.
%
% The general scheme for converting mass/charge values is to bin intensity
% values
% based on the interval the corresponding mass/charge values belongs to. The
% general procedure is
% as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item for a given bin size
%     \item determine the maximum and minimum mass/charge values in entire data
%set.
%     \item calculate the number of bins in the total mass/charge range.
%     \item centre the first bin at the minimum mass/charge value.
%     \item sum intensities corresponding to all mass/charge values that are in
%a
% given bin.
% \end{itemize}
%
% A specific function to round mass/charge values is also available. The
% process is that all intensity values for a mass/charge values that fall within
%a
% unit width about each given integer value are added together. In PyMS, a
% mass/charge is considered to belong to a bin when it is equal to or greater
% than half the bin width from the centre of the bin, and less than half the bin
% width from the centre of the bin.
% %That is, a mass/charge, $m$ is considered to belong to a bin when $c-w/2\le
% %m\lt c+w/2$, where $c$ is the centre of the bin, and $w$ is the width of the
% %bin.
%
% Figure~\ref{fig:binning} illustrates the process of assigning bins to the
% mass/charge axis and summing all intensities in a given bin. The result is a
% new mass/charge axis with mass/charge values corresponding to the centre of
% each bin.
%
% \begin{figure}[htp]

% \caption{Mass/charge intensity values are added to bins based on a pre-set bin
% size and the minimum mass/charge value of all the scan data. All intensities
%in
% a given bin width (top) are added and given a mass/charge value of the centre
% of the bin (bottom). For integer binning, each bin has a width of one and is
% centred at integer values.}

% An IonChromatogram object is a one dimensional vector containing
% mass intensities as a function of retention time. This can can be either
% m/z channel intensities (for example, ion chromatograms at m/z = 65),
% or cumulative intensities over all measured m/z (TIC).
%
% An ion chromatogram object has a method {\tt is\_tic()} which returns
% True is the ion chromatogram is TIC, False otherwise:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% >>> print "'tic' is a TIC:", tic.is_tic()
% 'tic' is a TIC: True
% >>> print "'ic' is a TIC:",ic.is_tic()
% 'ic' is a TIC: False
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \subsection{Writing data to a file}
%
% The method {\tt write()} of IonChromatogram object allows one to save
% the ion chromatogram object to a file:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% >>> tic.write("output/tic.dat", minutes=True)
% >>> ic.write("output/ic.dat", minutes=True)
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \noindent
% The flag minutes=True indicates that retention time will be saved in minutes.
% The ion chromatogram object saved with with the {\tt write{}} method is a
% plain ASCII file which contains a pair of (retention time, intensity) per
% line:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% $ head tic.dat
%   5.0944      745997.0000
%   5.1002      726566.0000
